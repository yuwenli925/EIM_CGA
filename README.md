EIM1d_Linf.m computes convergence rate of the EIM applied to ReLUk function set in L_\infty([0,1]) with k = 1,...,4;

EIM1d_L2.m computes convergence rate of the EIM applied to ReLUk function set in L_2([0,1]) with k = 1,...,4

CGA_Lp.m computes convergence rate of the CGA applied to ReLU0 function set in L_p([0,1]) with p = 2.5, 3, 3.5
